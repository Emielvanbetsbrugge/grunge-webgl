# Grunge webGL explorations
This project is made for learning and experimenting with webGL, in all it's forms.

Some of these explorations are purely shaders minded, others are more into handling objects and animating them.
I'll need to get some more insights in how to load interesting textures.

## Tech
I'm using create-react-app for the frontend, I'll need an interface between the react frontend and the webGL instance, but that'll be fine.

Feel free to have a look around. Let me know what you think!
